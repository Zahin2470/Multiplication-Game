# Multiplication-Game
**Conclusion:**
The Multiplication Game effectively combines strategic gameplay with low-level computer architecture concepts. By using structures to simulate registers, arrays for memory layout, and ncurses for I/O, it mirrors core principles like control flow, memory management, and performance-aware logic. The game not only offers engaging interaction but also deepens understanding of how software can simulate hardware-level operations in C.
